The balance/history tools use a network connection to make requests
against the load balancer backend.

It's possible to run as many backend workers as you like. The
load balancer (obbalancer) distributes requests evenly among the backends.
Use `worker-output.sh` to view debugging info from the worker. Each worker must
have its own unique copy of the blockchain database.

See the Obelisk config files in `/usr/local/etc/obelisk/`. The sx config file
is stored at `~/.sx.cfg` (there's an example at `/usr/local/share/sx.cfg`).
You can change this configuration parameter in Obelisk using
`./configure --sysconfigdir=/etc/`. By configuring different workers and load
balancers, you can run multiple setups on the same host. By default, it is now
pointing at my development server, but I will change this soon and migrate to
a new host. Also, I make no guarantees about stability or compatibility.
