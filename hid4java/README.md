### Project status

Late-Beta: Expect minimal API changes. Suitable for early production.

### Summary 

The hid4java project supports USB HID devices through a common API which is provided here under the MIT license.
The API is very simple but provides great flexibility such as support for feature reports and blocking reads with
timeouts. Attach/detach events are provided to allow applications to respond instantly to device availability.

The wiki provides a [guide to building the project](https://github.com/gary-rowe/hid4java/wiki/How-to-build-the-project).

### Technologies

* [hidapi](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi) - Native USB HID library for multiple platforms
* [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna) - to remove the need for Java Native Interface (JNI) and greatly simplify the project
* Java 7+ - to remove dependencies on JVMs that have reached end of life

### Code example

```java
// Get HID services
hidServices = HidManager.getHidServices();
hidServices.addHidServicesListener(this);

// Provide a list of attached devices
for (HidDeviceInfo hidDeviceInfo : hidServices.getAttachedHidDevices()) {
  System.out.println(hidDeviceInfo);
}

// Open a Bitcoin Trezor device by Vendor ID and Product ID with wildcard serial number
HidDevice trezor = hidServices.getHidDevice(0x534c, 0x01, null);

// Send the Initialise message
byte[] message = new byte[64];
message[0] = 0x3f;
message[1] = 0x23;
message[2] = 0x23;

int val = trezor.write(message, 64, (byte) 0);
if (val != -1) {
  System.out.println("> [" + val + "]");
} else {
  System.err.println(trezor.getLastErrorMessage());
}
    
```
 
### Getting started

The project uses the standard Maven build process and can be used without having external hardware attached. Just do the usual

```
$ cd <project directory>
$ mvn clean install
```

and you're good to go. Your next step is to explore the examples.

### Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

#### What platforms do you support ?

If you have a native version of `hidapi` for your platform then you'll be able to support it. 

Pre-compiled versions for Windows (32/64), OS X (10.5+) and Linux (32/64) are provided and you
must follow the JNA naming convention when adding new libraries.

#### Why not just use usb4java ?

The [usb4java](http://usb4java.org/) project, while superb, does not support HID devices on OS X 
and apparently there are no plans to introduce HID support anytime soon.
 
You will find that trying to claim the USB device on OS X will fail with permissions problems. If
you apply a workaround (such as adding a kernel extension) then it will still fall over just a
little later in the process. The bottom line is that you *must* use hidapi to communicate with HID
devices on OS X.

#### Is this going into Maven Central ?

Yes. There's a bit of general tidying work left to do to take it to a first release but when that's 
done it will be uploaded to Maven Central. 
 
#### Can I just copy this code into my project ?

Yes. Perhaps you'd prefer to use 

```
git submodule add https://github.com/gary-rowe/hid4java hid4java 
```
so that you can keep up to date with changes whilst still fixing the version. 


### Troubleshooting

The following are known issues and their solutions or workarounds.

#### I get a `SIGSEGV (0xb)` when starting up

This shouldn't occur unless you've been changing the code. 
You have probably got the `getFieldOrder` list wrong. Use the field list from Class.getFields() to get a suitable order.
Another cause is if a `Structure` has not been initialised and is being deferenced, perhaps in a `toString()` method.

#### My device doesn't work on Ubuntu

Out of the box Ubuntu classifies HID devices as belonging to root. You can override this rule by creating your own under 
`/etc/udev/rules.d`:

```
$ sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-myhid.rules
```

Make the content of this file as below (using your own discovered hex values for `idProduct` and `idVendor`):

```
# My HID device
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", ATTRS{idVendor}=="abcd", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
```

Save and exit from root, then unplug and replug your device. The rules should take effect immediately. If they're still not 
running it may that you're not a member of the `plugdev` group. You can fix this as follows (assuming that `plugdev` is not present on 
your system):

```
$ sudo addgroup plugdev
$ sudo addgroup yourusername plugdev 
```
