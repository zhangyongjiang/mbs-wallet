The `CTP_Nov2013` compiler is required due to the use of **C++11/14** features. You can [download the compiler add-on here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41151).

There are a number of NuGet packages required to compile. Several inject source code into the build, others are required for resolving references and linking. I currently have the NuGet references to my local (relative) NuGet repo embedded in the project files. If you don't have the packages in that location NuGet will produce errors.

I have packaged most of the necessary packages [here](http://www.nuget.org/profiles/evoskuil/) (you won't need all of these). You will also need various [Boost packages](http://sergey-shandar.blogspot.com/2013/08/boost-on-nugetorg.html), also available via NuGet.

It's easy to identify the necessary packages, just inspect the project's `packages.config` file.

There are also dependencies on [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin), and [obelisk](https://github.com/libbitcoin/obelisk). These are not yet packaged on NuGet. You will need to git these and build them each in sibling repo directories to this repo (by default).

Dynamic builds are available but are not yet functional. The develop branch is more current and it contains a build script for all non-dynamic build variants. If you use the develop branch you must use it for the libbitcoin dependencies as well.
