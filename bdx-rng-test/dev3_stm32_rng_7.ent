of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 257.24, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.3567 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.146565043 (error 0.16 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000653 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
