of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 293.62, and randomly
would exceed this value 5.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5393 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.144161774 (error 0.08 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000837 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
