of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 274.80, and randomly
would exceed this value 25.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4503 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.145123082 (error 0.11 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.001010 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
