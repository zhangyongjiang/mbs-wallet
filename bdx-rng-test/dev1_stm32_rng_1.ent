of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 223.73, and randomly
would exceed this value 90.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.3654 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.144115998 (error 0.08 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000020 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
