of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 268.67, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5329 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.138233712 (error 0.11 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000808 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
