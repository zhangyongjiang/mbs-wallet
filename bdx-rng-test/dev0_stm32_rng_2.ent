Entropy = 7.999803 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 286.78, and randomly
would exceed this value 10.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5551 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.138508371 (error 0.10 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000495 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
