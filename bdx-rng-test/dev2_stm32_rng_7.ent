of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 262.60, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.6353 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.143131802 (error 0.05 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.001268 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
