of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 256.90, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5297 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.139446790 (error 0.07 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.001620 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
